Guidelines to install the library packages:
LiquidCrystal library and Servo library are usually pre-installed in Arduino IDE.

1)LiquidCrystal library:
This library allows an Arduino board to control LiquidCrystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs.
Syntax: #include <LiquidCrystal.h>

For more information about this library please visit us at http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal

2)Servo library:
This library allows an Arduino board to control RC (hobby) servo motors.
Syntax: #include <Servo.h>

For more information about this library please visit us at http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo

Guidelines to install additional libraries in Arduino IDE:
Open the  Arduino IDE and click to the "Sketch" menu and then Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Then the Library Manager will open and you will find a list of libraries that are already installed or ready for installation.
 Scroll the list to find it, click on it, then select the version of the library you want to install. 
Sometimes only one version of the library is available. If the version selection menu does not appear, don't worry.
Finally click on install and wait for the IDE to install the new library. Once it has finished, an Installed tag should appear next to the installed library.
 You can close the library manager.
